1. Make a controller image overlay that is in PNG format and is 320x240 pixel width by height.

2. The controller overlay should have a place for the following buttons listed in the .txt file explained below.

3. Overwrite a controller_fsX.png image in the installation directory of psx4iphone where "X" is a number 0 to 5.

4. Make a corresponding controller_fsX.txt file with the following coordinates of the touch buttons on the 320x240 image you made:
DownLeft
Down
DownRight
Left
Right
UpLeft
Up
UpRight
Select
Start
L Trigger
R Trigger
Menu
Button DownLeft
Button Down
Button DownRight
Button Left
Button Right
Button UpLeft
Button Up
Button UpRight
L Trigger 2
R Trigger 2

5. Each button above should have coordinates in the following format: x,y,width,height

6. So the .txt file would look something like:
0,0,1,1
2,2,3,3
6,6,7,7
...
...
...

7. For an example look at the included controller images and txt files look in the installation directory of psx4iphone.
